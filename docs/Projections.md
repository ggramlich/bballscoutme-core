# Projections

The events stored for a game allow us to create different types of structural representations of game statistics.
These structural representations are called [projections](http://abdullin.com/post/event-sourcing-projections/).

Possible projections for the game state are:

- Information for a score board (score, points per player, fouls per player)
- Detailed statistics report
- Scoresheet as used in the various leagues

We can also create projections for players:

- Game statistics
- Season statistics
